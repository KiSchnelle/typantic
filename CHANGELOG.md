## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- `subpanels` option for `pydantic_to_typer` (off by default): groups CLI
  options into Rich help panels. Each option is placed in the panel named by
  the `cli_panel` class attribute of the class that defines its field, so
  models composed from mixins get organised `--help` output. Fields whose
  defining class declares no `cli_panel` stay in the default options group;
  arguments are never panelled.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- Bumped minimum `typer` requirement to `>=0.26` (upgraded from 0.25.1 to 0.26.7).
- Bumped dev dependency `ruff` to `>=0.15.16`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Initial release.
- `pydantic_to_typer` decorator that auto-generates a Typer CLI interface
  from a Pydantic model's fields, descriptions, defaults, and validators.
